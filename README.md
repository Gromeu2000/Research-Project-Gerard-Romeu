## **_Introduction_**
In this article, we will go through what quests are, what **quests** must be like and what 
they must **transmit**. Even though the information is mostly focused around the RPG and MMO 
genre, it can be useful to design quests for all kinds of games.

Quests may seem a **minor feature** of a game but quests must be properly developed in order 
to keep and reinforce players’ feeling of **immersion**. An important amount of good games 
tend to have a poor approach to **Quest Design**, due to a low amount of resources being put
into it, which can make the whole product to **fail**. Pointing resources and time to quests,
on the other hand, normally make the game to have a notable success because of it.


## **_What is a quest?_**
### **_Definition_**
According to wikipedia “_A quest, or mission, is a task in video games that a 
player-controlled character, party, or group of characters may complete in order 
to gain a reward_”.

This is the basic definition and as, lot of us may know, anything we can do by 
**ourselves** or group to get a reward to upgrade your character or to advance deeper 
into the game is a quest. Anyway, there are different **types** of quests and more 
things have to be clear before starting to wonder our quests for our future game.

### **_Main types of quests_**
**Main Quests** - Main Quests are focus points in the narrative, story, etc. 
Anything that is not related to the main story or plot of the game can not be 
considered one Main Quest and is considered as a Side one.

Main Quests normally tell the story of a protagonist -who tends to be the player. 
They can be used to reach important points into the narrative determined by the 
protagonist’s transformation. Main Quests start at the early stages of the game, 
introducing the main story, and develop it as the player progresses.

**Side Quests** - Instead of narrating the main storyline, Side Quests help to explain, 
describe and discover the world that surrounds the main character, as well as its 
inhabitants, while existing out of the main narrative. These let the player explore 
the world without being linked with the main plot. Normally, side quests are useful to 
upgrade your character’s level to access to Main Quests with more experience so those 
quests are not too tough, among others,... 

Side quests can make or break your game — good ones draw players further into your world; 
bad ones may sour players on the entire experience.


## **_Categories of quests_**
Quests are classified and divided into 5 different types:
