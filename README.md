## **_Introduction_**
In this article, we will go through what quests are, what **quests** must be like and what 
they must **transmit**. Even though the information is mostly focused around the RPG and MMO 
genre, it can be useful to design quests for all kinds of games.

Quests may seem a **minor feature** of a game but quests must be properly developed in order 
to keep and reinforce players’ feeling of **immersion**. An important amount of good games 
tend to have a poor approach to **Quest Design**, due to a low amount of resources being put
into it, which can make the whole product to **fail**. Pointing resources and time to quests,
on the other hand, normally make the game to have a notable success because of it.
