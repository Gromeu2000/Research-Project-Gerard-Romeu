## **_Introduction_**
In this article, we will go through what quests are, what **quests** must be like and what 
they must **transmit**. Even though the information is mostly focused around the RPG and MMO 
genre, it can be useful to design quests for all kinds of games.

Quests may seem a **minor feature** of a game but quests must be properly developed in order 
to keep and reinforce players’ feeling of **immersion**. An important amount of good games 
tend to have a poor approach to **Quest Design**, due to a low amount of resources being put
into it, which can make the whole product to **fail**. Pointing resources and time to quests,
on the other hand, normally make the game to have a notable success because of it.


## **_What is a quest?_**
### **_Definition_**
According to wikipedia “_A quest, or mission, is a task in video games that a 
player-controlled character, party, or group of characters may complete in order 
to gain a reward_”.

This is the basic definition and as, lot of us may know, anything we can do by 
**ourselves** or group to get a reward to upgrade your character or to advance deeper 
into the game is a quest. Anyway, there are different **types** of quests and more 
things have to be clear before starting to wonder our quests for our future game.

### **_Main types of quests_**
**Main Quests** - Main Quests are focus points in the narrative, story, etc. 
Anything that is not related to the main story or plot of the game can not be 
considered one Main Quest and is considered as a Side one.

Main Quests normally tell the story of a protagonist -who tends to be the player. 
They can be used to reach important points into the narrative determined by the 
protagonist’s transformation. Main Quests start at the early stages of the game, 
introducing the main story, and develop it as the player progresses.

**Side Quests** - Instead of narrating the main storyline, Side Quests help to explain, 
describe and discover the world that surrounds the main character, as well as its 
inhabitants, while existing out of the main narrative. These let the player explore 
the world without being linked with the main plot. Normally, side quests are useful to 
upgrade your character’s level to access to Main Quests with more experience so those 
quests are not too tough, among others,... 

Side quests can make or break your game — good ones draw players further into your world; 
bad ones may sour players on the entire experience.


## **_Categories of quests_**
Quests are classified and divided into 5 different types:

**Who Says Fighting Never Solved Anything? - Kill Quests** - _“These robots are 
terrorizing our village, and it needs to stop! Please destroy as many as you can find!”_ 

Kill quests are straight forward: find x monsters in the region and kill them.

**The Only Time You’ll Ever Toggle Run/Walk – Escort Quests** - _“I hear there are 
bandits on the roads these days, please help me get back to my family.”_
Exactly as it sounds: your job is to follow this NPC to their destination, 
oftentimes protecting them along the way.

**Hoarders: MMO Edition – Gather Quests** - _“I need to bake a cake. Go fetch me some 
Deku tree roots.”_
The job of the player is to go around the map and bring x number of a certain object.
 
 
**A Gift for that Special Someone – Delivery Quests** - _“I don’t have the courage to 
do this myself, so could you give Sarah these flowers for me?”_
The job is simple, the player has to go and deliver a thing to a certain place.


**Immerse Yourself – Interaction Quests** - _“Please, you call those dance moves? I’ll 
show you how it’s done!”_
There is no reason interacting with NPCs—or the game world—shouldn’t give the players 
experience points. The focus of these quests are the less used mechanics.

## **_Basic pillars of quests design_**
Every year we play hundreds of quests, but a huge number of them disappear 
into the mists of memory. As I mentioned before, quests can make the difference 
between two similar games. 
There is not a unique way to create quests that will make yours shine among the 
others or a infallible formula that will make them perfect. Anyway, this are basics 
and **tips** created from Patrick Mills, designer at **CD Projekt RED** the creators of _Witcher 3_, 
that is considered one of the best games ever talking about quest design subject. 
So, let’s start with that quest design masterclass. 

**A good quest can come from anywhere**

![](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/9_2.jpg)

Starting with a **blank** sheet of paper is a nightmare for anyone in a creative industry, 
and that’s certainly true for quest designers. Just where do you start in creating 
something that will get people playing? Well, it could be literally anywhere.
With even the smallest idea, a quest can be **coaxed out**. It’s all about applying 
something that is **worthwhile** to the situation. 

**Every quest must tell a story**

![](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/10_1.jpg)

It’s obvious that the player wants to be interested in the story that 
the quest itself explains. Question that comes to the player’s mind is: Why should I, 
hero of the realm, spend my time finding fish for the local fisherman? All too often these 
types of quest make little sense, and have no **narrative framework** to support the task.

**Banish your fear of dialogue**

![](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/11_1.jpg)

Talking of **dialogue** is important, we can’t be frightened to use it. It’s easy to think 
that conversation in games should simply be there for narration or because It’s needed, 
but when done correctly, dialogue is an equally **engaging** element of the game.
If your scenes and your story is **interesting**, then that is gameplay and people will 
enjoy playing it. 

**Don’t underestimate your audience**

![](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/12_1.jpg)

You’re not going to capture a player’s imagination if you don’t give them anything to 
think about, and if your player isn’t engaged, then why do they want to play at all? 
We should never back away from **complexity** we should trust in our audience and try to 
**challenge** them. If we’ve made something interesting, we trust that if players are engaged 
they can understand and appreciate complexity. The only time people they really **shy away** 
from complexity is when it’s presented in such a way that they’re not engaged with it or 
they feel **powerless** to it. Making your game engaging is what makes it accessible.

**Make the world relatable**

![](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/13_1.jpg)

One thing that’s important in life is making **big decisions**. We’ve all had to do it, 
and we understand that when it comes to major choices nothing is clear. 
Frequently, most games make the mistake of **revealing** major repercussions just 
seconds after a choice has been made, allowing players to reload saves without having 
to spend time re-playing large sections. There’s no real deal to making sure the end 
result of a choice is the way the player wants it to be. 

**Let the player do what they want**

![](https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/14_1.jpg)

When combining quest and story design, it’s important to remember that there are 
two people involved: the player and their character. In a **non-interactive** medium like 
a film it’s fine for the hero to head off and do something that the audience doesn’t 
want them to do. But in games the audience needs to want to get **involved** too. 
**Force** players to perform tasks they don’t want to do, and you’ve failed them.


## **_Creation process_**
### **_How are quests designed in professional teams?_**
It is often assumed that a quest designer is a **writer**, essentially responsible for 
just quest text and dialogue. The truth is, that's about 5% of a quest designer's job. 
Quest designers are **storytellers**, but the best quest designers tell story with the world 
far more than text.

For most teams, a quest designer is responsible for planning and building content 
primarily for outdoor zones. This involves identifying major stories and themes, 
creating characters, planning creature ecologies, planning a "flow" through the zone, 
and identifying gameplay opportunities along the way.
Depending on the studio, this can mean a quest designer can have a great deal 
of independence in the characters they want to make and the stories they want to tell, 
as long as they generally fit the game. In this context, level designers build the 
physical world itself.  Terrain, trees, buildings, textures. They do this working 
closely with quest designers is possible to plan around the content that is going to 
be placed there.

After a plan has been put together and approved, and some basic level design has been 
made, a quest designer begins to put it all together.

As all designers, quest designers have to **communicate** everything they need from other 
teams, so forming good relationships with other subteams makes for a better designer.


## **_Example of good/bad quest design_**
When creating quests there are some things that que may **watch out** and we can 
completely avoid thanks to these 3 tips that in most of the cases may be the difference 
between a success and a completely failure quest. All of the tips are recaps from most 
of companies when creating quest for video games, their **successes and their errors**. 
These are the guidelines:

  - A good quest **informs** the main plot or the area it’s located in in all respects — 
    lore, NPCs, etc.
  - Side quests should be **quick and fun** to complete (15 min).
  - Side quests should use the **core gameplay mechanics** and avoid special case 
    new functionality (or be careful with it). 

Now, having these **guidelines** interiorized, let’s start with best example of video games 
on the quests subject. Any way, I want to go deeper in this topic and as we may know a 
lot of video games that are highly successful thanks to a certain number of quests, 
but we might not know which ones are those quests. So why don’t we take a deep look 
to the **best and worst** quests of some video games? Let’s start. 

### **_Good examples_**
**Finding JC – South Park: The Stick Of Truth**

If there's one thing South Park doesn't shy away from, it's **irreverence**. 
In The Stick of Truth, this is quite literal. In this quest, you'll be tasked 
with finding him in the town's church. Once you've done so, you'll be able to 
summon him in any non-boss battle. This is an example of how a side quest can alter 
the main gameplay being able to play with the “reward” of the quest as a **trophy** to 
explore the map until you find JC.

**Witcher Wannabe – The Witcher 3**

In this awesome quest you have to face a “Witcher”. This false WItcher is terrible. 
He can't even take on a single ghoul, and when you find him, he's hiding, instead. 
What makes this quest great? It is like a **judgement**, you get to decide what the 
**consequences** of impersonating a witcher are. Do you give him to the village elder, 
with grim consequences? Let him go? There are a few **options available**, and it's up to 
you to make the punishment or let him go.

**The Papyrus Mysteries – Assassin's Creed: Origins**

The Papyrus Mysteries feel like what **collectibles** would be if they had a point. 
Exploring the landscape of ancient Egypt, you can find papyrus scrolls, 
each containing clues about an item hidden in the world and its location. 
So far, so collectible regularity. It's how these scrolls use the vast landscape 
at their disposal that is fascinating. There are huge parts of the map that have 
no **purpose** other than for these scrolls, and they can provide you with frankly 
incredible views and extraordinarily fun puzzles. These are collectibles done in a 
right way.

### **_Bad examples_**
**Kid In The Fridge – Fallout 4**

Fallout has always had a pretty dark, **serious** tone. This quest is just terrible. 
It doesn't make anything clear and it just leaves you with a ton of more questions. 
This kid has been stuck in the fridge for 200 years, and yet, is totally fine? Why is 
he just totally unharmed and unchanged by the whole experience? It just messes with 
the tone and the main plot of the game: It’s **incoherent**.

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0X03qTUVrrM/maxresdefault.jpg)

**Finding The Korok Seeds: Breath Of The Wild**

Even the best games in the world are lacking in the development and planning of quest. 
Anyway, we all know that Breath of the Wild is superb. That being said, collectibles 
aren't fun for 99 percent of players. It feels like **meaningless busywork*. 
Breath of the Wild takes this annoying little habit of modern gaming to a whole other level. 
While in other games you may have a few hundred **collectibles**, there are no fewer than 
900 of these things hidden throughout the world.

**Getting The Master Sword – Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess**

The process of getting the Master Sword exemplifies what's **wrong** with this quest. 
Getting to the sword's resting place takes an absolute age. It's also a deeply 
**frustrating** experience. You have to follow Skull Kid down interminable paths, 
then solve a puzzle that involves moving statues into the correct position. 
These statues mirror your movement. It is an **upset experience**.
